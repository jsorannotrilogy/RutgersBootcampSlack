# Rutgers Bootcamp Slack Community Guidelines && Code of Conduct

## This policy was adopted from the FrontendLondon Slack community.This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future. This policy applies to every Rutgers Bootcamp entity or event, including but not limited to the Slack community, in-person meetups, and our alumni program.


The simple version:

be nice
be honest
be supportive

The details:

The **Rutgers Bootcamp Alumni Community** should be a safe place for everybody regardless of

- gender, gender identity or gender expression 
- sexual orientation
- disability
- physical appearance (including but not limited to body size)
- race
- age
- religion

As someone who is part of this Slack, you agree that:

* We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
* We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humour.


We actively work towards:

* Being a safe community
* Cultivating a network of support & encouragement for each other
* Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression


We condemn:

* Stalking, doxxing, or publishing private information
* Threats of harm, harassment
* Anything that compromises people’s safety

**These things are NOT OK.**

If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

* Listen without interruption.
* Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
* Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offence in the future.
* Apologize and ask forgiveness.

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries consequences. For minor infractions, you may be temporarily suspended from the Slack. Upon repeat offenses, or if the community believes you are not acting in good faith, you may be asked to leave permanently. If you have an issue with someone, Rutgers Continuing Education, or anything else, please contact your SSM or PM the mods in private.


**If you experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, please DM Juanita on Twitter (@juanitasoranno) or email juanita.soranno@ccpd.rutgers.edu.**


*Juanita will not moderate or edit anything written in the Slack unless it is required as a result of a discussed dispute.*

*Job adverts that don't specify the company or require contacting an external recuriter to apply will be removed*
